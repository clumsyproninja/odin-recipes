  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This crispy chicken sandwich is finger-lickin’ good! Seasoned floured chicken breasts are fried before being placed in a bun and finished with your favorite toppings. The chicken is so perfectly tender and juicy and the coating is perfectly crispy and full of flavor!</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Seasonings</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the chicken in a small shallow bowl and add milk to the bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In another small bowl, whisk the eggs until scrambled.</li>
    <li>In a third bowl, stir together the flour and seasonings until well mixed.</li>
    <li>To prepare the chicken, coat each milk covered chicken breast with the flour/seasonings mixture. Dip the coated chicken breast into the whisked eggs, then back into the flour and seasonings mixture. Gently place each piece of chicken onto a plate, until all pieces have been dipped and coated.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in an electric skillet or large/deep pan. Use enough oil to cover the chicken, about 1-2 inches depending on the thickness of the chicken. If using an electric skillet, heat the oil to 375°F.</li>
    <li>Once the oil is heated, place 2 of the chicken breasts in the skillet and allow to cook until they are golden brown. This will take about 5-7 minutes on each side.</li>
    <li>Assemble the sandwiches as you wish with your favorite sauces and garnishes.</li>
  </ol>
